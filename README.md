# The Wonderpose

A student project based on machine learning. You can find an illustrated documentation here: https://fhp.incom.org/project/20726.

## Code

The code setup consists of ml5js, an algorithm that builds on the PoseNet and TensorFlow libraries. It is a pretrained Machine Learning (ML) model. The browser experience is created by using the pose estimation model PoseNet which runs in the browser using TensorFlow.js, itself a library that allows web developers to train and run machine learning models in the browser.

## Browser Prototype

You can try out the browser run prototype by opening the index.html file. Enjoy the experience :).
